Hardware, High Level Synthesis, and Software Implementation of the One-Time Pad Stream Cipher
This work presents the design considerations and implementation strategies for One-Time Pad Stream Cipher:
As part of the CS4110 course on Hardware/Software Co-Design. The objective of this project is to explore and evaluate multiple implementation paradigms, Register Transfer Level (RTL), High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and Software (SW)â€”targeted for FPGA platforms, including Basys3 and Zybo. Each implementation has been integrated into a unified system architecture that features a consistent command line interface to ensure usability and comparability between methodologies. The study highlights the trade-offs between design abstraction levels, resource utilization, development effort, and runtime performance. Through systematic analysis and empirical evaluation, this document aims to provide insight into the challenges and advantages associated with the deployment of cryptographic primitives across heterogeneous design flows.
